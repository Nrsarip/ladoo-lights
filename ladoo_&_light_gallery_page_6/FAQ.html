          <h1>Questions about designing your celebration</h1>
          <p>
            From budget-friendly haldi backdrops to multi-day baraat, sangeet, and
            reception builds, here are the answers to the questions we hear most often.
            We keep every celebration rooted in tradition while delivering an elevated,
            contemporary experience.

            <p>
              If you do not see your question here, we are happy to schedule a call to
              discuss the specifics of your venue, rituals, and vision.

            <h3>How early should we book?</h3>
            <p>
              Peak season weekends book 6–9 months in advance. If you are planning a
              multi-event celebration (haldi, mehndi, phera, reception), we recommend
              connecting as soon as dates are set so we can design cohesive looks for each
              ceremony.

            <h3>Do you travel for destination weddings?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Our team produces destination weddings across India and overseas. We
              coordinate with local vendors for florals, staging, and lighting while
              bringing signature décor, textiles, and art pieces from our studio.

            <h3>Can you work within our budget?</h3>
            <p>
              We prioritize high-impact focal points—mandap, entrances, and photo areas—to
              maximize your budget. After our design consultation, we provide a transparent
              estimate with optional upgrades so you can choose where to splurge or save.

            <h3>What does the design process look like?</h3>
            <p>
              We begin with moodboards that reflect your rituals and color preferences,
              then build a cohesive plan for florals, draping, lighting, and signage. You
              will receive a timeline, material samples, and a production checklist before
              we start fabrication.

            <h3>Do you handle rentals and vendors?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely. We manage stage rentals, seating, linens, and power needs,
              collaborating with trusted partners or your preferred vendors. Our team also
              oversees installation and teardown so your family can focus on the rituals.

            <h3>Can you incorporate family heirlooms?</h3>
            <p>
              We love to. Whether it is a treasured sari for the backdrop, brass urli
              centerpieces, or ancestral photographs, we design vignettes that honor your
              heritage while maintaining the refined aesthetic of the celebration.
